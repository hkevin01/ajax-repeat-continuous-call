This project provides a robust AJAX polling mechanism for continuously checking server-side results and updating the user interface in real time. It is designed for web applications that require frequent status updates from the backend, such as monitoring dashboards or notification systems.

## Short-Term Goals
- [ ] Refactor code to modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- [ ] Organize project into logical directories
- [ ] Add core documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Set up basic unit tests
- [ ] Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated testing

## Long-Term Goals
- [ ] Expand support for additional backend endpoints
- [ ] Improve modularity and extensibility
- [ ] Enhance error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Increase test coverage and add integration tests
- [ ] Foster community contributions and feedback

## Intended Audience
- Web developers building real-time or polling-based web applications
- Teams seeking a template for AJAX-based continuous server communication
- Contributors interested in modernizing legacy JavaScript projects
