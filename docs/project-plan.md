### Project Functionality Analysis
This project implements a continuous AJAX polling mechanism to check for observation results from a server and update the UI accordingly. It uses jQuery for AJAX calls and colorbox for modal dialogs. The main logic is in `wait.js`, which repeatedly queries the server and updates the display based on the response.
